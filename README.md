# Web Application Security Research 2021
The project involves securing web based applications with defense mechanims that will prevent injection attacks. Topics: Software Security, Web Application Security, Web Browser Security, Privacy.

#### What I Have Learned So Far: ####
- We are manually setting up and running docker containers to simplfiy the process of setting up environments to test PHP web applications.
- Worked on bash scripts, these can be added to execute a seqeunce of command line commands, they can be called in the docker-compose.yaml file to make things easier.
- Setting up a container lets you use multiple command prompts, giving you more freedom in what you want to do.
- We are connecting databases to each of the web applications because we will also be testing content that is stored.
- How to connect those PHP apps to the container and interacting with it on the localhost in my browser.

#### How I Set Up The Environment: ####
I was tasked with [**PHP Gurukul Hospital Management System**](https://phpgurukul.com/hospital-management-system-in-php/) and [**PHP Gurukul Shopping**](https://phpgurukul.com/shopping-portal-free-download/).
